-Use 2 dimentional array to store the sales data
-Use 1 dimentional array for the following:
-     hold the names of the stores
-     hold the names of the months
-     hold the total sales for each store (city)
-     hold the monthly totals
-declare all arrays as static class variables, before main method
Creates and calls(from main()) 4 methods. These methods must be static.
     initializes these arrays using the initialization lists: 2d array with all the sales data, store and months
          special method instead of initializing imediately
     Calculates the total sales for each city (declares the size of this array)
     Calculates the monthly totals (and declares the size of this array)
     Prints out the results (see the sample output below).  If you want help getting the output to line up, 
          use printf (see the printf PowerPoint and/or the link below



NOTE: you will need this syntax to initialize an array in the method:
	cities = new String[] { the cities go here â€“ use initialization lists};

%-10s to line up string on left, 10 columns
